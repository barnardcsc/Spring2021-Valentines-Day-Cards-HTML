# Valentine's Day Cards, Spring 2021
This workshop will introduce you to HTML, CSS, and (a little bit of SVG) in order to create two cards or memes:
1. text with styling, and an animated svg element. 
2. text over an image. 

We then host them as websites on Github. After, we code buttons and embed them into emails so that you can send your loved one a pretty button that 'on click' takes them to your card or meme!

Use the markdown file included to follow along with the descriptions and code examples.

You can also use this workshop as a beginning step to building a website!  
Once you are familiar with HTML & CSS you will be able to navigate and modify open source website templates such as these: 
  - https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp
  
Or, you can build it from scratch.
