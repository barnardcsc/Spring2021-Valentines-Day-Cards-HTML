# Valentine-s-Day-Cards-Spring2021
This workshop will introduce you to HTML, CSS, and (a little bit of SVG) in order to create two cards or memes.  1. text with styling, and an animated svg element.  2. text over an image.   We then host them as websites on Github. After, we code buttons and embed them into emails so that you can send your loved one a pretty button that 'on click' takes them to your card or meme!  ----  Use the markdown file included to follow along with the descriptions and code examples.    For more fun and interactice CSS and HTML pratice, try out this free, online resource!   - https://flukeout.github.io/    You can also use this workshop as a beginning step to building a website!   Once you are familiar with HTML &amp; CSS you will be able to navigate and modify open source website templates such as these:    - https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp    Or, you can build it from scratch.  If you are a Barnard student and you are interested in a comprehensive Barnard program for website building, you may be interested in the Athena Digital Design Agency.   - https://www.athenadigitaldesign.org
